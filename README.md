## Description
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our app, Real Deals, is designed to help our users to search multiple website platforms to find the cheapest price. <br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This App uses BarcodeSpider API to search multiple website platforms for prices on products given the users search terms. The user then can choose which platform they would like to order the product from and then save it to their profile/saved list. On the users profile, they can view which products they have saved, can decide which products they would like to remove from the list, and can view the total dollar amount of the combined products. Each profile page is user specific.  <br><br>
